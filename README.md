Transformer-Based Framework for Multi-Document Summarization of Turkish Legal Texts with Ensemble Enhancements
This repository contains the complete codebase for a hybrid summarization framework designed for Turkish legal documents. The framework builds on powerful transformer models—including LED, Long-T5, BART-Large, and GPT-3.5 Turbo—to generate multi-document summaries that are legally accurate, coherent, and semantically faithful.

To further enhance performance, the system incorporates three ensemble strategies:

CASVM (Consecutive-Aware Semantic Voting Mechanism)

WHSRF (Weighted Hybrid Sentence Ranking Framework)

T5-Meta (a fine-tuned Long-T5 model serving as a meta-seq2seq generator)

The project supports reproducibility and extensibility for legal NLP research in low-resource languages and is based on the paper “A Hybrid Transformer-based Framework for Multi-Document Summarization of Turkish Legal Documents.”
